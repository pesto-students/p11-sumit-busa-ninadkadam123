#### What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?

Protocol stack is Group of protocol running concurrently to implement network protocol suit. It determine the interconnectivity rule between devices, servers, clients.
**Use in web development**
In web development we have Protocol stack in different layer such as

- **Link layer:** This layer is responsible for internet connection over network connected with Ethernet or Wireless LAN .
- **Network layer:** This layer is responsible for connection between different network .It mainly uses IP or ICMP.
- **Transport Layer:** Data transfer occure in this layer between client server .It uses TCP, UDP, to transfer the data. The data is transfer in small small packet in TCP
- **Application layer:** Uses HTTPS and TLS to serve the website over secured encrypted connection.

#### What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

There are mainly four type of web server Apache, IIS, Nginx and LiteSpeed.

- **Apache:** It is open source server . We can easily customize an apache web server due to its modular structure. Since it’s an open source, our own modules can be added to the server. It is highly stable as compared to other web servers and the administrative issues on it can be resolved easily. It is possible to install Apache on multiple platforms successfully.
- **IIS:** IIS is a server that offers all the features such as Apache. Since it’s not an open source, adding personal modules as well as modifying becomes a bit difficult.
- **Nginx:** It is open source server. It comprises of IMAP/POP3 proxy server. The significant features offered by Nginx are high performance, stability, simple configuration and low resource usage.
- **LiteSpeed:** This web server known for nown for providing fast performance and high scalability.Reduce complexity by eliminating the need for an HTTPS reverse proxy or additional 3rd party caching layers. It increases the performance with reduced cost.

#### What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?

A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that hosts websites for clients.One or more website are hosted on single host.There are different type of web hosting.

- **Shared hosting:** In This hosting two or more website are hosted on same server. This is most affordable type of hosting.But the performance of shared hosting is low as single server resources are shared with multiple website.
- **Cloud hosting:** In this hosting website or application is hosted on cloud network. Scalability, data delivery speed are benefits of cloud hosting.We have to pay for only resources we used. Availiabity is high.Infrastructure cost is reduced.
- **Manage hosting:** In this hosting maintanence of server taken care by hosting company.
- **VPS hosting** (Virtual Private Server hoisting):In this hosting the multiple virtual server are created on one physical server using virtualization. It provide greater flexibility.
- **Dedicated hosting:**In this type of hosting website or application is hosted on single server. This is most secured hosting used in banking.
  This hosting provide full control of the server.

#### What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

Scaling is ability to increase or decrease the resourses of sever such as RAM CPU storage. It allows the achievement of high availability and performance. It allow us to manage increase in traffic, increases the performance.
Horizontal scaling and vertical scaling are two types of scaling.

| Horizontal Scaling                            | Vertical Scaling                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| New server is added in Horizontal scaling     | Resources are increases in Vertical scaling          |
| Cost is higher as compare to Vertical scaling | Cost is lower as compare to vertical scaling         |
| It is Highly Flexible                         | Flexibity is low                                     |
| Reliability is High                           | Reliability is low as the As there is single machine |
| This Scaling require Less downtime            | This Scaling may require high Downtime               |
| Harder to maintain                            | Easier to maintain                                   |
